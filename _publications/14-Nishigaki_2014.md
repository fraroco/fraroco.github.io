excerpt: 'Intracellular pH (pHi) regulation is essential for cell function. Notably, several unique sperm ion transporters and enzymes whose elimination causes infertility are either pHi dependent or somehow related to pHi regulation. Amongst them are: CatSper, a Ca 2+ channel; Slo3, a K + channel; the sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger and the soluble adenylyl cyclase. It is thus clear that pHi regulation is of the utmost importance for sperm physiology. This review briefly summarizes the key components involved in pHi regulation, their characteristics and participation in fundamental sperm functions such as motility, maturation and the acrosome reaction.'

Intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) regulation is essential for cell function. Notably, several unique sperm ion transporters and enzymes whose elimination causes infertility are either pHi dependent or somehow related to pH<sub>i</sub> regulation. Amongst them are: CatSper, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel; Slo3, a K<sup>+</sup> channel; the sperm-specific Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger and the soluble adenylyl cyclase. It is thus clear that pH<sub>i</sub regulation is of the utmost importance for sperm physiology. This review briefly summarizes the key components involved in pH<sub>i</sub> regulation, their characteristics and participation in fundamental sperm functions such as motility, maturation and the acrosome reaction.
