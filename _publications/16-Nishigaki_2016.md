title: "CatSper, el canal de Ca2+ que regula el batido flagelar del espermatozoide en eucariontes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/01/07/16-Nishigaki_2016
excerpt: 'CatSper is a sperm-specific Ca2+ channel. In mammals, the elimination of any of the distinct pore-forming subunits results in male infertility. CatSper is a moderate voltage-dependent channel, activated by intracellular alkalization and extracellular ligands (in certain species). The activation of this channel exhibits a change in the swimming pattern from an activated to hyperactivated motility. In sea urchin, CatSper has been described as the modulator of the sperm chemotaxis toward the oocyte. Interestingly, this channel is present from the common ancestor of eukaryotes. Nevertheless, it is absent in some taxonomic groups where possibly another protein replaced its function during the evolution.'

CatSper is a sperm-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. In mammals, the elimination of any of the distinct pore-forming subunits results in male infertility. CatSper is a moderate voltage-dependent channel, activated by intracellular alkalization and extracellular ligands (in certain species). The activation of this channel exhibits a change in the swimming pattern from an activated to hyperactivated motility. In sea urchin, CatSper has been described as the modulator of the sperm chemotaxis toward the oocyte. Interestingly, this channel is present from the common ancestor of eukaryotes. Nevertheless, it is absent in some taxonomic groups where possibly another protein replaced its function during the evolution.
