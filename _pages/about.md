## PERSONAL SUMMARY
My name is Francisco Romero, I recently completed my _Ph.D._ at the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](https://www.unam.mx). During my graduate studies, I focused my research on understanding the physiology of some sperm-specific molecules. In particular, I developed and applied data science and statistical tools to predict the functional coupling among proteins in animals.

Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at Arca Continental, the second most important bottler for the Coca-Cola company. Since I started working in this company, I have led a main project in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA. This project aims to address the fundamental question made by the product owner and I had to be involved in each decision taken during the project.

My experience is based on my own and leverages other deep business domain knowledge to design data-driven business decisions using analytic approaches and determine the appropriate data sets and variables to solve them. I am able to work closely with business managers and IT teams to turn information into interpretative knowledge that can be used to make company decisions. My expertise may also contribute to identifying business risks and opportunities to industrialize relevant data science products in the market, as well as in the features selection to build and optimize classifiers using machine learning techniques. Moreover,  I have worked with structured and unstructured data from disparate and third party sources of information as well as the performance of mining data. About the data quality, I have been involved in cleansing and validation of the accuracy, completeness, and distribution of the data.

During my academic trajectory, I have improved my skills in developing stories and visualization to effectively communicate complex analysis in a precise, actionable and clear manner to an audience with different backgrounds. Furthermore, I have experience in Bash scripting and UNIX utilities, using programming languages like [R](https://www.r-project.org/), Scala, [SQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) and parallelization and optimization in programming with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [MPI](https://www.openmp.org/).
